# Titanic-Survival-Predictor
The Titanic Survival Predictor is a data science project that leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. Using the famous Titanic dataset, this project explores the correlation between various passenger features such as age, gender, class, and embarked port with the probability of survival.
